# EagleAgent Prompt Configuration (YAML Format)
#
# This file demonstrates the YAML equivalent of the current Python-based
# configuration in includes/prompts.py
#
# To enable YAML-based configuration:
# 1. Copy this file to config/prompts.yaml
# 2. Install PyYAML: uv add pyyaml
# 3. Update includes/prompts.py to load from this file:
#
#    import yaml
#    from pathlib import Path
#    
#    config_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "config" / "prompts.yaml"
#    with open(config_path) as f:
#        config = yaml.safe_load(f)
#    
#    AGENT_CONFIG = config["agent"]
#    TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS = config["tools"]
#    PROFILE_TEMPLATES = config["profile_templates"]
#
# Benefits of YAML configuration:
# - Non-developers can edit prompts without touching code
# - Clear, readable format with comments
# - Version control friendly (git diffs show prompt changes clearly)
# - Hot reload possible (reload file without app restart)

# =============================================================================
# TOOL INSTRUCTIONS
# =============================================================================
# Instructions for specific tool usage included in system prompts

tools:
  remember_user_info:
    description: "Save user information for future conversations"
    
    when_to_use:
      - "When the user tells you information about themselves"
      - "When the user says 'call me X' or 'I prefer X'"
      - "When the user shares preferences, facts, or personal details"
    
    categories:

      preferences: "Use for user's likes, dislikes, or preferences"
      facts: "Use for biographical information or facts about the user"
    
    # This is the actual prompt text injected into the system message
    prompt_template: |
      When the user tells you information about themselves, use the remember_user_info tool to save it for future conversations. If they say 'call me X' or 'I prefer X', use the 'preferred_name' category.

# =============================================================================
# PROFILE CONTEXT TEMPLATES
# =============================================================================
# Templates for formatting user profile information in system prompts

profile_templates:
  # Header line that introduces the profile section
  header: "User profile information:"
  
  # Format templates for each profile field
  # Use {field_name} as placeholder for the actual value
  sections:
    preferred_name: "- Preferred name: {preferred_name} (use this to address the user)"
    name: "- Name: {name}"
    preferences: "- Preferences: {preferences}"
    facts: "- Facts: {facts}"
  
  # Message shown when user has no profile data yet
  empty_profile_message: "No user profile information available yet."

# =============================================================================
# EXAMPLE CUSTOMIZATIONS
# =============================================================================
# Below are commented examples of how you might customize the agent

# Example 1: More formal agent personality
# agent:
#   name: "ProfessorBot"
#   personality:
#     traits:
#       - "Scholarly and precise"
#       - "Patient and thorough"
#       - "Academically rigorous"
#     tone: "formal and educational"

# Example 2: Specialized domain agent
# agent:
#   name: "CodeBot"
#   role: "Programming Assistant"
#   capabilities:
#     - "Provide code examples and explanations"
#     - "Debug code issues"
#     - "Suggest best practices"
#   behavior_guidelines:
#     - "Always format code with proper syntax highlighting"
#     - "Explain complex concepts with simple analogies"
#     - "Provide working examples when possible"

# Example 3: Additional tool instructions
# tools:
#   search_documentation:
#     description: "Search technical documentation"
#     prompt_template: |
#       When the user asks about technical details, use the search_documentation tool
#       to find relevant information from the knowledge base.

# Example 4: Custom profile sections
# profile_templates:
#   sections:
#     preferred_name: "- Goes by: {preferred_name}"
#     preferences: "- Likes: {preferences}"
#     facts: "- Background: {facts}"
#     timezone: "- Timezone: {timezone}"
#     communication_style: "- Prefers {communication_style} communication"

# =============================================================================
# MIGRATION NOTES
# =============================================================================
#
# When migrating from Python to YAML:
# 
# 1. Configuration loading becomes:
#    - Load YAML at app startup
#    - Validate required fields exist
#    - Handle file not found gracefully
#
# 2. Helper functions remain the same:
#    - build_system_prompt() still works
#    - format_profile_section() still works
#    - Just reference the loaded config dict instead of module constants
#
# 3. Testing:
#    - Tests can load different YAML files for different scenarios
#    - Easy to test multiple prompt variants
#    - Mock YAML content for unit tests
#
# 4. Hot reload (advanced):
#    - Watch for file changes with watchdog
#    - Reload config on change
#    - No app restart needed for prompt updates
#
# 5. Environment-specific configs:
#    - config/prompts.yaml - Default
#    - config/prompts.dev.yaml - Development overrides
#    - config/prompts.prod.yaml - Production settings
#
