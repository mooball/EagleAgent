# MCP Server Configuration
#
# Configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that provide additional tools
# to the EagleAgent. Supports STDIO, HTTP, and SSE transports.
#
# Copy this file to mcp_servers.yaml and configure your servers.
# Environment variables can be referenced using ${VAR_NAME} syntax.

servers:
  # Example: Filesystem MCP Server (STDIO transport)
  # Provides file system operations
  filesystem:
    transport: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - "-y"
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
      - "${MCP_FS_PATH}"  # Set MCP_FS_PATH env var to allowed directory path
    env:
      # Optional environment variables for the MCP server process
      # HOME: "${HOME}"
  
  # Example: GitHub MCP Server (STDIO transport)
  # Provides GitHub API operations
  # Requires GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
  github:
    transport: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - "-y"
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"  # Set in .env file
  
  # Example: Custom HTTP MCP Server (HTTP transport)
  # For custom MCP servers with HTTP/REST interface
  # custom_api:
  #   transport: http
  #   url: "${MCP_API_URL}"  # e.g., https://api.example.com/mcp
  #   headers:
  #     Authorization: "Bearer ${MCP_API_TOKEN}"
  #     Content-Type: "application/json"
  
  # Example: Server-Sent Events transport
  # sse_server:
  #   transport: sse
  #   url: "${MCP_SSE_URL}"  # e.g., https://mcp.example.com/stream
  #   headers:
  #     Authorization: "Bearer ${MCP_SSE_TOKEN}"

# Notes:
# - STDIO servers run as local processes (command + args required)
# - HTTP/SSE servers connect to remote endpoints (url required)
# - OAuth tokens can be passed via headers for HTTP/SSE servers
# - Missing environment variables will log warnings but won't crash the app
# - Invalid server configs are skipped during initialization
# - The agent works normally even if no MCP servers are configured
